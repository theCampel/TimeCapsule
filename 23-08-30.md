## The Future?

According to GPT-4, a _time capsule_ is a _“snapshot capturing the essence of an era, preserved for future generations to explore and understand”_. These essays are exactly that. 

Also let the record show I would have had a wildly more inaccurate essay only a year ago. That’s because generative Ai only became mainstream and Apple’s Vision Pros were  announced in 2023.

_Ding_! I looked up and saw the “seatbelts” sign, now brightly illuminated. The bell’s ding barely pierced the slow melodic drum of the airplane’s engines. My eyes were irresistibly pulled to the view beyond the 737's quaint windows, to the Edinburgh landscape unfolding rapidly before them. As it morphed from greenery to roads to runway, I couldn’t help but reminisce to my student days here, taking this exact flight every 3 months. And then a sudden realisation struck me: my first visit to Edinburgh was over a decade ago. The familiar landscape masked a new world, one technologically redefined. 

I was wrenched out of my daze by the twenty-something next to me. She was clearly a nervous flyer, with fists clenched on the armrests to either side. With each turbulent thrust of wind I saw her stomach drop lower and lower. Her long dark hair swayed with each jolt of the plane. But most intriguing to me were the pair of ski-goggles-esque headset that adorned her face. I regonised them instantly as Apple’s latest Visions, an XR headset that allowed her to seamlessly mix between the real and virtual world. Her pair was even customised to match her outfit. 

Clearly a fashionable Gen-Z, her headset showed she was “engaged”. An animation of blue and purple waves of light, akin to the Aurora Borealis, danced atop her goggles. The “engaged” animation implied she was in full Virtual Reality, completely shut off from the real world. I wondered where she was virtually at that exact moment. 

Gaining inspiration from the animation, I imagined she was in a peaceful arctic retreat, gazing at the beautiful spectral show of the Northern Lights. I realised it was a lot more peaceful than being in a flying tube of metal hurtling towards the ground at a concerning velocity. 

But no virtual trickery could disguise the lurching of the plane as its tyres landed - crashed - onto the runway. No matter how technologically advanced our society became, I knew a turbulent RyanAir landing was something you could rely on. 

My attention was drawn back to the girl. She’d clearly switched back to “Present” mode, as I now saw her eyes through the goggles. As she reached for her bags, she paused momentarily, her eyes dancing around the screen. She was probably catching up on all of the notifications she’d received while flying. My theory was all but confirmed when I saw her thumbs methodically tap specific fingers - the modern way of clicking on these goggles. 

While the passengers began to disembark, my mind wandered back to the girl beside me, speculating just how profound her aversion to flying might be. These XR headsets are notoriously unreliable on planes or cars, but if she was willing to use it regardless, her situation must have been quite dire. Wow. Flying must have been extremely difficult for her before this technology.

As I exited the airport, I popped on my own pair of Visions and called an Uber. _“Driven or Autonomous?”_ a prompt asked me. It only then dawned on me that the Lothian Council had granted permission for self-driving vehicles to roam its streets the month prior, a full year after my first autonomous experience in London. Wanting to play my own music, I selected _Autonomous_. 

As I waited on the bench for my ride into town, I switched my Visions to “Engaged” mode and replayed the Lakers and Bulls basketball game that happened just the night before. As last night’s _experience_ loaded up, I was completely and suddenly transported to the United Center Basketball stadium, any traces of Edinburgh erased. I could see celebrities sat next to me, all cheering with each shot, rebound and block. Animated fireworks all exploded above me after each three-pointer. A floating scoreboard danced in my peripheral, coming into focus with a single glance. The surround sound of the squeaking sneakers or cheering supporters around me only helped further immerse myself in this field. 

As technologically impressive as it was, I still knew the result of the game. Bulls were on their league-winning streak. This game was no different. It was a nice change of pace to them only a couple years back when they struggled to gain any notoriety. As a result, I whipped up a single 2D screen playing this morning’s F1 race to the corner of my eye. Ironically, it gave me joy to see Redbull, a once outrageously dominant team, struggle to break P5. Just as McLaren crossed the finish line, the real world faded back into view. It was my Visions alerting me my Uber had arrived, with a convenient green waypoint indicating which of the many Toyota Priuses was mine. As I entered, my Visions authenticated with the empty vehicle, ensuring I was the correct passenger for the transport.

Almost instantly, my Visions wirelessly connected as a guest to the car’s modern Apple CarPlay system. _The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill_ started playing, but I quickly changed it. I opted to listen to _BBC Radio 4(U)_ for my ride into town. 

Presenters Emil and Vicky bantered about how they passed their weekends. Emil began a longwinded rant about how he tried for hours to get some money from some class action lawsuit, only to end up getting £2. Vicky, with her soft Cardiff accent, began cackling up at this. A bit more light banter pursued before they mentioned they were going to continue the music with a throwback to the mid 2010’s. As the sound of drums began to play, I couldn’t help but crack a smile. My favourite song at the time, _Love Is Only a Feeling _by _Joey Bada$$_, began playing. Of course, this was no mistake. 

_BBC Radio 4(U)_ was custom radio station I created on Spotify, shaped to my personal tastes and whims. The presenters, Emil and Vicky, were two Ai radio hosts I modelled off of their real-life radio host counterparts. Fortunately for me, real-life Emil and Vicky opted to make their voices and mannerisms free for public use. This meant I could listen to a radio show with charismatic hosts that played the exact music I enjoyed. These Ai hosts never spoke too little or too much (according to my taste anyway), cracked jokes and always spoke about things that were relevant to me, whether or not I knew it. It was like magic, save for their occasional hiccup in the Ai-infused humor. This was especially notable when tones of voice didn’t line up with the punchline, but it was a small price to pay for music I always enjoyed. 

I rummaged through my bag for my old iPhone 20. I used my Visions more often, but I occasionally enjoyed the more tactile experience of typing on glass. Also, I was about to catch up with Pi and the experience was hit or miss when there were no microphones nearby. 

Like a lot of people my age, I had a personal Ai assistant. But while many renamed theirs, I kept the default name: Pi. According to its creator, Ai studio Inflection, _Pi_ stood for _Personal Intelligence_. I customised everything else about it so that it could serve me the best possible use, but I always opted away from changing its name. I thought it would be the final barrier I broke down before completely anthropomorphising one of the _things_ I spoke to so often. 

“Pi are you there?” I called out.

“Hey Leo.” a South Dublin voice, distinctly feminine, responded gently. “How can I help you?”

“Catch me up would you please”

“Sure thing. Your colleague Andrej scheduled a meeting for today at 2pm. I know you’re on PTO, but he mentioned in the invite it’s about trialling a new product. I know you enjoy those trials, so I haven’t responded to the virtual meeting invite yet. Would you like to go?”

“I’d love to. Book a nearby co-working space with a separated meeting room that I can take the meeting in. If it’s less than 10 minutes walk away, don’t bother booking a taxi there.”

“Great. I’ll get on that” she asserted. “Also, Google are after settling a class action lawsuit with the citizens of the EU and UK under the EU Ai Act for how they trained LLMs on user data. I’ve scanned the details of the case, and you’re eligible for some compensation. I can't guarantee it’ll be much, but I can get it sorted. Do I have your consent to provide your banking details to exclusively the relevant parties so that you can get paid?”

“I, Leo Camacho, give you consent to share my banking details.” I asserted. I always found it amusing how professional you had to be with Pi when it came to data sharing. She wouldn’t accept a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’. “Anything else?” I continued. 

“Yes. Last thing. I saw on your FindMy that your sister is up from Manchester in Newcastle. With the new LNER train in operation, her journey up from Newcastle to Edinburgh would only be 30 minutes. Do you want to arrange to do something with her? Keep in mind your meeting Tom and Gregor at 8.”

“That’s a great idea Pi. Change your settings to encourage me to focus meeting my friends and family more by making more offers like those. Now send the following voice message transcript to Manny: ‘Hey Manny. Saw you were back in Newcastle for the week. Want to come up to Edinburgh for some dinner? The new LNER train is finally up and you’d legit only take 30 mins getting here. If you’re down let me know and I’ll get Pi to book your tickets’”. 

“No worries Leo. Also, while we were talking I sent a _reflection_ of myself to talk to Google’s Legal Ai. You were entitled £50, but you received £40 into your account as I took 20% commission. Also, I spoke with the Ai of The Melting Pot, a local co-working space, and you’re booked in for 2-2:30. The transcripts of both conversations I had have been sent into your inbox.”

“That’s perfect. Thanks Pi.”. I quickly scanned over the conversations Pi had with the Ai’s but found nothing of interest. I chuckled at how Pi actually tried arguing I was entitled to £75 to Google’s Legal Ai, but to no avail. 

This was one of my favourite features of modern day chatbot assistants: their accountability and ability to talk to other chatbots. My Pi was able to send a copy of itself, with my interests in mind, to talk to (Ai or not) representatives of companies. It could report back to me with its findings, with it's conversation recorded and sent back to me. This was the single feature that made me feel most like I was living in the future. Of course, it wasn’t perfect. Not all businesses had an Ai representative Pi could converse with. Some that did severely limited the abilities it had to simple information providing. That meant that no matter what you did, you’d have to manually go onto the web to do what you were looking to do. But because Pi, and other similar Ai’s, prioritised businesses it could talk to, there was tremendous economic incentive to develop an Ai for your business.

I got £40 for doing nothing. It once again became clear to me that Pi was the single best investment I could make. Pi costs me £50 a month, but between the money  she earns me and the time she saves me, she’s easily paid herself of multiple times over. Once again, it shocked me that Pi, or Ai’s like her, were still more unpopular than popular despite the immense use they served.
